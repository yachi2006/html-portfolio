# html-portfolio
This is my first portfolio website project, developed using only HTML. The purpose of this project is to understand HTML structure, semantic tags, and basic webpage layout. The portfolio includes sections such as About Me, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact, and represents my initial step into web development as a Computer Science student.
